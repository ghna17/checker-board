# checker-board
Write a program called checkers.py that shows a standard checkerboard centered within a window. The checkerboard must use 2 colors for its squares and the distance between the edge of the board and the edge of the window must be the same as the width of a square.
HINTS:	a) Before you start coding, identify the smallest unit you must use to build up this image.
		b) Create a variable to be that unit first.
		c) Use that variable to create everything else, including the graphics window.
		d) Try to use as few lines as possible.
